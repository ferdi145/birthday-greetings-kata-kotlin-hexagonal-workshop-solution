# What's this?

This is a basic Kotlin Version of the birthday greetings kata. It is used for explain and do the basics of Hexagonal Architecture 

This is a fork [from this kata](https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata). I've made some changes to it, to start from a slightly different place.

## Setup
mvn test runs the tests, they should all be passing to begin with

## How to start

Run all the tests.  One test will fail.  Change production code so that all tests pass.
